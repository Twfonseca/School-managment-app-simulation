# School-page
This project arose from the need to exercise my skills with JavaScript, more specifically arrays, functions, objects and some animations.
The project consists of making several pages to simulate a  management web application.
  what I want to explore and improve: Semantic HTML, responsive design, CSS skills, Js skill specifically : arrays, functions, objects, programming logic.
